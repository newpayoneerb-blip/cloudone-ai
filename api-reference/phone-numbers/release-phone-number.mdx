### Release Behavior

The release behavior depends on the phone number type:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Dedicated (normal)** | Subscription is cancelled. Number remains active until the end of the billing period, then is released. |
| **SIP** | Immediately deleted from your account. |
| **Caller ID** | Immediately deleted from your account and removed from the telephony provider. |

<Warning>
Once a phone number is released, you may not be able to get the same number back. Make sure to update any assistants or campaigns using this number before releasing it.
</Warning>

### What Happens to Attached Resources

When you release a phone number:
- Any **inbound assistants** attached to this number will have their phone number unassigned
- Any **campaigns** using this number will have it removed from their phone number rotation
- **Call history** is preserved and remains accessible
