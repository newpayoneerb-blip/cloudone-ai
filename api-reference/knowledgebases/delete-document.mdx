### What Gets Deleted

When you delete a document:

- **Document record** is removed from the database
- **Vector embeddings** are deleted from the vector database
- **Processed content** is removed from external document stores
- **Parent knowledgebase status** is updated automatically

<Warning>
This action is irreversible. The document and all its processed content will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

<Note>
If this was the last document in the knowledgebase, the knowledgebase status will change to `empty`.
</Note>
