## Pricing

Each user message in a **widget** conversation costs **$0.01**. Test conversations are free.

## Function Calls

The assistant may execute functions during message processing, such as:

- **Calendar operations**: Checking availability, booking appointments
- **Knowledge base queries**: Searching documentation or FAQs
- **Custom integrations**: Calling your configured webhook endpoints

Function call results are included in the response so you can display relevant information to the user or track actions taken.

## Best Practices

1. **Handle errors gracefully**: Display user-friendly messages when errors occur
2. **Show loading states**: The assistant may take a few seconds to respond, especially when executing functions
3. **Preserve conversation ID**: Store the conversation UUID to allow users to resume conversations
4. **Respect rate limits**: Implement appropriate delays between messages if needed
