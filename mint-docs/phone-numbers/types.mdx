Autocalls.ai lets you connect three different kinds of phone numbers to your AI assistant:

1. **Normal (Dedicated) Numbers**

   - Rented directly from Autocalls.ai.
   - Can be used for **both inbound** and **outbound** calls.
   - Typically charged as a monthly rental, with the ability to handle multiple parallel calls on a single number.

2. **SIP Integration (VOIP/PBX)**

   - Connect an existing VOIP or PBX number via SIP.
   - This setup allows you to keep your existing numbers while benefiting from Autocalls.ai's AI.
   - Works for **both inbound and outbound**—see our [SIP Integration Guide](/provisioning/sip-trunking/sip-integration) for setup instructions.
   - You can configure this directly in your dashboard under Phone Numbers.

3. **Caller ID (Outbound Only)**
   - When you already have a phone number (e.g., your personal or business line) but don't want to port it or integrate via SIP.
   - You verify ownership (via OTP or a short call) so that number can appear on people's caller ID.
   - **Inbound calls won't be answered by the AI** if you use Caller ID alone—it only masks the AI's outbound calls.

## Choosing the Right Option

- If you need **inbound** and you don't already have a VOIP solution, consider renting a dedicated number.
- If you have an established **PBX** or VOIP provider, use **SIP integration**.
- If you just want to do **outbound** calls showing your existing phone line, pick **Caller ID**.
