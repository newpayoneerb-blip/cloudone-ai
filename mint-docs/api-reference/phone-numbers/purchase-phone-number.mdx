### How It Works

1. **Search** - First use the [search endpoint](/api-reference/phone-numbers/search-phone-numbers) to find available numbers
2. **Purchase** - Submit the phone number you want to this endpoint
3. **Automatic Processing** - The platform:
   - Validates the number is still available
   - Determines the correct pricing based on country
   - Creates a monthly subscription on your payment method
   - Provisions the number with our telephony provider
   - Creates the phone number record in your account

<Warning>
Phone number purchases are non-refundable. The subscription will continue until you [release the number](/api-reference/phone-numbers/release-phone-number).
</Warning>
