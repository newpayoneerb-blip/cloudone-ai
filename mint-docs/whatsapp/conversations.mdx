## How WhatsApp Conversations Work

### Customer Initiates Contact

1. Customer sends a message to your WhatsApp number
2. System creates or finds existing conversation
3. Message is routed to your AI assistant
4. AI generates and sends response
5. 24-hour messaging window opens

### Within the 24-Hour Window

- AI responds automatically to each message
- Free-form replies are allowed
- Conversation continues naturally

### After 24 Hours

- Customer must message again to reopen window
- You can send template messages to re-engage
- AI remains ready to respond when customer replies

## Conversation Features

### Message History

### Conversation Variables

## AI Assistant Behavior

Your AI assistant handles WhatsApp conversations based on its configuration:

### System Prompt

The same system prompt used for voice calls and web widgets applies to WhatsApp. Ensure your prompt works well for text-based communication.

<Tip>
**Text-Friendly Prompts** — For assistants that handle both voice and WhatsApp, consider including instructions for text formatting like using bullet points and shorter paragraphs.
