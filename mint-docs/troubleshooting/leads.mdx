Quick solutions for common lead management problems and import issues.

## Lead Import Issues

### Import Fails Completely
**Error:** "Import failed" or "File format not supported"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file format:** Use CSV or Excel files only
2. **Verify campaign selection:** Ensure a campaign is selected for import
3. **File size limits:** Keep files under 10MB for optimal performance
4. **Encoding issues:** Save CSV with UTF-8 encoding

### No Leads Imported
**Issue:** Import completes but no leads appear

**Solutions:**
1. **Column mapping:** Verify you mapped the phone number column during import
2. **Data validation:** Check that phone numbers are in correct format
3. **Empty rows:** Remove empty rows from file
4. **Required fields:** Ensure phone number column contains valid data
5. **File headers:** Ensure your CSV/Excel has a header row (any names work)

### Partial Import Success
**Issue:** Some leads imported, others failed

**Solutions:**
1. **Download error report:** Check failed rows for specific issues
2. **Phone number format:** Ensure international format (+1234567890)
3. **Duplicate detection:** Remove duplicate phone numbers
4. **Invalid data:** Fix malformed phone numbers or missing required data

### Processing Delays
**Issue:** Import shows as processing for extended time

**Explanation:**
- Large files are processed in background
- Processing time increases with file size
- System queues multiple imports

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for completion:** Check notifications for updates
2. **Break up large files:** Split into smaller batches (500-1000 leads)
3. **Contact support:** If processing exceeds 30 minutes

## Lead Management Issues

### Lead Not Appearing in Campaign
**Issue:** Imported lead doesn't show in campaign

**Check:**
- Lead status (should be "Created" or "Scheduled")
- Campaign filters or search settings
- Lead marked as completed accidentally

**Solutions:**
1. **Reset lead status:** Change status to "Created" to re-queue
2. **Verify campaign assignment:** Check lead is assigned to correct campaign
3. **Refresh interface:** Reload campaign page

### Invalid Phone Numbers
**Issue:** Phone numbers rejected during import

**Common formats:**
- **Correct:** +1234567890 (international format)
- **Incorrect:** (123) 456-7890, 123-456-7890, 1234567890

**Solutions:**
1. **Standardize format:** Convert all numbers to +1234567890 format
2. **Remove formatting:** Strip spaces, parentheses, dashes
3. **Country codes:** Add appropriate country code prefix
4. **Validation tools:** Use phone validation before import

### Duplicate Leads
**Issue:** Same person appears multiple times

**Prevention:**
1. **Data cleanup:** Remove duplicates before import
2. **Phone validation:** Check for format variations of same number
3. **Name matching:** Identify potential duplicates by name + phone
4. **Lead deduplication:** Use tools to identify similar entries

### Secondary Contacts Not Working
**Issue:** Secondary contacts not being called

**Requirements:**
- Secondary contact must have valid phone number
- Primary contact must reach max retries first
- Campaign must be configured for secondary contacts

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify setup:** Check secondary contact configuration
2. **Lead status:** Ensure primary contact has been attempted
3. **Campaign settings:** Confirm secondary contact calling is enabled

## Variable and Data Issues

### Variable Mapping Errors
**Issue:** Custom variables not importing correctly

**Solutions:**
1. **Column mapping:** Ensure you correctly mapped each variable to its column during import
2. **Auto-detection:** System auto-detects mappings based on common column names
3. **Data types:** Ensure data matches expected variable types
4. **Required variables:** Map all variables defined in [assistant configuration](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)
5. **Default values:** Unmapped variables will use assistant's default values

### Missing Lead Information
**Issue:** Leads missing names, emails, or custom data

**Solutions:**
1. **Column mapping:** Verify all columns are mapped correctly
2. **Optional fields:** Confirm optional fields are included in import
3. **Data validation:** Check source data for completeness
4. **Re-import:** Add missing data and re-import if needed

## Campaign Integration Issues

### Lead Status Problems
**Issue:** Leads stuck in wrong status

**Status meanings:**
- **Created:** Ready to be called
- **Scheduled:** Queued for next attempt
- **Processing:** Currently being called
- **Completed:** Finished or goal achieved
- **Max Retries:** Reached retry limit

**Solutions:**
1. **Manual status change:** Update status in leads table
2. **Campaign restart:** Pause and restart campaign if needed
3. **Retry settings:** Adjust max retries or intervals

### Variable Inheritance Issues
**Issue:** Lead variables not working in calls

**Solutions:**
1. **Assistant setup:** Verify variables defined in [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)
2. **Variable names:** Ensure exact match between lead data and assistant variables
3. **Data format:** Check variable data is in expected format
4. **Test calls:** Use manual test calls to verify variable passing

## File Format Issues

### CSV Problems
**Common issues:**
- Wrong delimiter (use comma, not semicolon)
- Missing headers in first row
- Quoted fields with unescaped quotes
- Mixed encoding (use UTF-8)

**Solutions:**
1. **Standard format:** Use comma-separated values
2. **Headers required:** First row must contain column names
3. **Text qualification:** Use double quotes for text fields
4. **Encoding:** Save as UTF-8 encoded CSV

### Excel Problems
**Common issues:**
- Multiple sheets (only first sheet imported)
- Merged cells causing data misalignment
- Formulas instead of values
- Hidden characters or formatting

**Solutions:**
1. **Single sheet:** Use only first worksheet
2. **Unmerge cells:** Separate merged cells
3. **Values only:** Convert formulas to values
4. **Clean format:** Remove special formatting
