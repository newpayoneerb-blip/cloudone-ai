A customizable bot you configure to handle inbound or outbound calls. Defines conversation style, voice, and behavior via a "system prompt."

A dedicated phone number that customers dial to reach your AI assistant. You can get one from the platform or integrate via SIP/PBX.

## [Outbound Caller ID](/outbound-calls/caller-id)

## [No-Code Automation Platform](/automation-platform/introduction)

Autocalls.ai's built-in workflow platform, similar to Zapier/Make. It lets you connect triggers (like "call ended") to actions (like "send an email" or "update a Google Sheet") without writing code.

## [Tools / Integrations](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools)

Refers to the specialized features your AI assistant can use, like transferring a call, ending a call, scheduling an appointment, or webhooks to external apps.

## [Post-Call Variables](/ai-assistants/settings/post-call-actions#post-call-variables)

## [Call Variables](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)

Dynamic data that personalizes each call (like `customer_name`, `email`, `company`) and can be used in system prompts and automations.

The current state of a lead in your system: Created, Scheduled, Processing, Completed, Rescheduled, or Max Retries.

## [Campaign Status](/campaigns/index)

The current state of a campaign: Draft, In Progress, Paused, or Completed.

## [Webhook](/api-reference/webhooks/post-call-webhook)

A URL endpoint that receives data when specific events occur (like call endings), enabling real-time integrations with external systems.

## [SIP Integration](/provisioning/sip-trunking/sip-integration)

A method to connect your existing phone system or VOIP provider with Autocalls.ai without renting new numbers.
