## Widget Modes

Choose how visitors interact with your assistant:

### Voice & Chat (Recommended)
Users can seamlessly switch between voice and text during conversations.

**Best for:**
- Maximum flexibility for users
- Accessibility (voice for mobile, chat for quiet environments)
- Complex interactions requiring both modes

### Chat Only
Text-based messaging interface only.

**Best for:**
- Customer support and FAQs
- Environments where voice isn't appropriate
- Lead capture and qualification forms

### Voice Only
Real-time voice conversations only.

**Best for:**
- Phone-like experience on website
- Voice-first use cases
- Hands-free interactions
