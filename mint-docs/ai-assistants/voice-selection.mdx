Your AI assistant can speak with **built-in voices** or a **custom cloned voice**. Natural, realistic voices increase customer trust and engagement.

## TTS Provider

Select your Text-to-Speech provider in the assistant settings. Available in **Pipeline** and **Dualplex** modes.

**Available Providers:**
- **ElevenLabs** - High-quality voices
- **Cartesia** - Fast, low-latency synthesis

The TTS Provider dropdown appears after selecting a language.

## Voice Library

Each TTS provider has its own voice library. Select male/female, accent, or language based on your provider.

## Voice Cloning

Clone a voice from an audio sample. Available in **Pipeline** and **Dualplex** modes.

**Clone to Provider:**
- **Cartesia** - Single audio file, at least 10 seconds, 1 speaker, no background noise
- **ElevenLabs** - Samples over 1 minute, 1 speaker, no background noise. Max 5 minutes total. Quality over quantity.

**Steps:**
1. Click "Clone voice" next to voice selector
2. Select provider (Cartesia or ElevenLabs)
3. Choose the voice language
4. Enter a name for your voice
5. Record or upload audio
6. Wait for processing

## Best Practices

1. **High-Quality Audio**: Clearer samples give better results
2. **Steady Delivery**: Natural tone, no abrupt changes
