<Update label="V1.7.2" description="Jan 26 2026">

### 🔥 New Call Features: Warm Transfers + Keypad Digits Collection

We’ve added two major capabilities to make AI phone agents more reliable in real-world support and sales scenarios — smoother human handoff and faster, more accurate data capture.

☎️ Warm Call Transfer (Hold + Brief + Connect)

<Frame>
 <img

 alt="Image"
 />
</Frame>

When a caller asks to speak with a human, your AI can now run a **true warm transfer**: it puts the customer on hold (with music or silence), dials a supervisor/agent, **briefs them with context**, and only then connects both sides.

**Why it’s better**

- ✅ **Context preserved:** agents don’t start cold — they already know what the customer needs.
- 🎶 **Professional experience:** caller hears a hold message + hold music while the agent is reached.
- 🔁 **More compatible transfers:****Web calls can now transfer to real human phone agents** (the initial interaction doesn’t need to be a phone call anymore).
- For **SIP trunks without SIP REFER**, warm transfer now works by creating a new **SIP INVITE** and merging calls — no REFER required.

**Configurable options** Supervisor number, caller ID mode, hold music/silence, hold message, supervisor briefing instructions, and the final “connected” message.

⌨️ Customer Keypad Digits Collection (DTMF)

<Frame>
 <img
 src="/resources/0R4hEUj2GrQ4btiOSJRqOqD22k7ZE87dhYECpzru.png"
 alt="Image"
 />
</Frame>

Customers can now enter digits on their phone keypad during a conversation, and the assistant receives the input instantly and continues naturally.

**How it works**

- Runs **in the background** — no awkward pauses
- Auto-submits after a configurable timeout (default **5s**)
- Instant submit when the user presses **#** or *****
- Works alongside voice: customers can **speak or type**

**Perfect for** Account numbers, PINs, phone numbers, license plates, order codes — especially when accuracy and privacy matter.

**Configurable options** Input timeout + submit key (# or *).

These upgrades make your assistants feel more human, more reliable, and easier to deploy in production support environments.

<Update label="v1.7.1" description="Jan 10 2026">

### ↗️ WhatsApp External Numbers Integration

You can now connect **external WhatsApp sender numbers;** like your own mobile number or SIP/business-owned lines and use them to **fully automate WhatsApp messaging** inside the platform.

### What’s included

- 📲 **Bring your own sender**: use your existing number instead of being limited to platform-provisioned WhatsApp numbers
- 🤖 **Inbound + outbound automation**: the AI can reply to incoming messages and send outbound follow-ups, reminders, and lead qualification messages
- ✅ **Simplified onboarding** via Meta Embedded Signup with **OTP verification** (SMS/voice) — no complicated Meta setup guesswork

### Where you’ll find it
Create a new WhatsApp sender from the platform and choose the **External Number** path. Once connected, you can submit message templates for approval to Meta and use your connected number to **send and receive WhatsApp messages** with AI handling the conversation end-to-end.

This update unlocks a more “native” customer experience — your AI can operate at scale on WhatsApp while keeping your brand identity and sender number consistent.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.7.0" description="Jan 8 2026">

### ✍️ AI Prompt Writer, 🧩 Flow builder & 🟢 Whatsapp native integration

This update packs three major upgrades that change how you build assistants end-to-end: **prompting becomes conversational**, **flows become visual**, and **WhatsApp becomes native** — with a setup that skips the usual Meta headaches.

## ✍️ AI Prompt Writer

<Frame>
 <img
 src="/resources/Opnlq1kcM53iN4TWEkiPd7q7mmXjzRUE28xR3ITg.png"
 alt="Image"
 />
</Frame>

Edit prompts by chatting with AI — no manual prompt engineering required.
- **Conversational editing:** just say what you want (“make it more friendly”, “add return policy info”) and the AI updates your system prompt.
- **Smart diff preview:** review changes before applying — additions, removals, and edits are clearly highlighted.
- **Accept/reject control:** apply suggestions one-by-one or in bulk, so you stay in full control.
- **Quick actions:** one-click improvements like *Make concise*, *Add detail*, *Improve clarity*.
- **Variables + schema built-in:** manage pre-call variables (e.g. {customer_name}) and define structured post-call extraction fields (string/number/boolean) without leaving the editor.
- **Template library:** start from proven templates for sales, support, scheduling, surveys.

Now you can refine assistant behavior quickly — without technical skills.

## 🧩 Flow Builder

<Frame>
 <img
 src="/resources/Bqsbdh2d6e9z2vqWyafDnVwh2kKYv57Xk25A97kt.png"
 alt="Image"
 />
</Frame>

Design conversation flows visually with drag-and-drop — perfect for production ready flows.
- **Node-based builder (5 node types):** Start, Speak, Prompt, Action, End.
- **Branching logic:** build multi-path conversations (Interested / Maybe / Not Interested) with clear outcomes.
- **Settings panel:** customize agent personality (name, language, assertiveness, humor) per flow.
- **Auto-layout:** one click to neatly organize your flow.
- **Import/Export JSON:** share flows across assistants or teammates instantly.

Build complex, multi-branch scripts without writing long prompts — faster iteration, cleaner structure, easier collaboration.

## 🟢 WhatsApp Native Integration

<Frame>
 <img
 src="/resources/uCyFS8rdZaEBpRoz4NBKZRGubcU2lzwAnvDlASWc.jpg"
 alt="Image"
 />
</Frame>

Connect your AI assistant to WhatsApp Business in minutes — and let it handle **both inbound and outbound messaging** automatically.

### ✅ Setup that’s actually easy
Meta’s WhatsApp onboarding is notoriously complex (business setup, verification, templates, embedded signup, compliance). We’ve turned that into a guided flow so you can go from zero to live quickly:

- Simple onboarding wizard that walks you through the required Meta steps
- Platform-assisted setup that removes the usual guesswork and friction
- You get WhatsApp running without spending days figuring out Meta’s process

### 🤖 AI-managed inbound + outbound WhatsApp
Once connected, your assistant can:

- Reply instantly to **incoming messages**
- Send **outbound messages** proactively (follow-ups, reminders, confirmations, lead qualification)
- Keep a consistent “brain” across channels — same assistant logic, same data, same tone

### 🔜 What’s coming next

- **External numbers support (soon):** right now WhatsApp can be activated on **numbers from our platform**, but bringing your own number is coming next.
- **WhatsApp calls support (soon):** we’re expanding from messaging to calls so you can handle the full lifecycle in one channel.

Together, these updates make assistant-building dramatically faster—**design flows visually, refine behavior by chatting with AI, and deploy natively on WhatsApp** for end-to-end omnichannel automation.

### 🧠 Campaigns just got smarter

We’ve added powerful new controls to help you get more out of your outbound campaigns, avoid wasted calls, and make sure every lead gets the attention it deserves.

Here’s what’s new:

### **1. Campaign Call Status Options**
You now have **three new controls** at the campaign level to fine-tune how your leads are called:

- **Retry until goal completed** *Continue calling until the goal is achieved.* Perfect for situations where a lead answers but doesn’t complete the desired action (e.g., no appointment booked). Calls will continue until the selected **goal variable** is marked as true.
- **Retry on voicemail** *Continue calling until a human answers (skip voicemails).* If a call hits voicemail, the lead won’t be marked as completed — the system will retry until someone picks up.
- **Goal variable** *Variable that must be true to mark lead as completed.* Select from your variables which one determines a “completed” lead. If the variable is false, the lead will be retried instead of being marked as completed.

### **2. Update Lead Data/Status from Automation Platform or API**
You can now **update lead details and statuses directly from your connected automation tools or API calls**.

- Change lead status (e.g., “created” instead of “completed”) dynamically.
- Push updated information into your campaigns without manual edits.

### **3. Ringing Timeout in Assistant Settings**
A new **ringing timeout** option in the Assistant settings lets you control how long to wait for an answer before moving on.

- For outbound campaigns, set it **lower** to avoid voicemail and save agent time.
- For campaigns with slower-answering customers, increase it to give them more time to pick up.
