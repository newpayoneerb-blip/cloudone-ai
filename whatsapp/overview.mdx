## What is WhatsApp Business Integration?

WhatsApp Business integration allows you to connect your AI assistants to WhatsApp, enabling automated text-based conversations with customers through the world's most popular messaging platform.

With this integration, you can:

- **Receive customer messages** and respond automatically with AI
- **Send template messages** to start conversations or re-engage customers
- **Use AI-powered replies** for 24/7 customer support
- **Trigger automation flows** based on WhatsApp conversations

## Understanding WhatsApp Business Rules

WhatsApp has specific rules for business messaging that you need to understand:

### The 24-Hour Messaging Window

<Info>
When a customer messages you, a **24-hour window** opens where you can send free-form messages. After this window closes, you must use an **approved template** to re-engage the customer.
</Info>

- **Within 24 hours**: Send any message directly
- **After 24 hours**: Must use a pre-approved template message

### Template Messages

Template messages are pre-approved message formats required for:

- Starting new conversations with customers
- Re-engaging customers after the 24-hour window
- Sending notifications, updates, or marketing messages

Templates must be submitted to Meta for approval before use (typically takes minutes to 24 hours).

### Quality Rating & Limits

Meta monitors your messaging quality. New senders start with limited messaging capacity that increases as you maintain good quality:

| Quality Level | Daily Message Limit |
|--------------|---------------------|
| New Sender   | ~250 messages       |
| Low Quality  | 1,000 messages      |
| Medium       | 10,000 messages     |
| High Quality | 100,000+ messages   |

<Warning>
High block rates or spam reports will lower your quality rating and reduce your messaging limits. Always send relevant, requested content.
</Warning>
