A WhatsApp Sender is a phone number registered with WhatsApp Business API that can send and receive messages. Each sender is connected to an AI assistant for automated responses.

## What is a WhatsApp Sender?

A WhatsApp Sender is:

- A dedicated phone number connected to WhatsApp Business
- Connected to an AI assistant for automated responses
- Capable of sending template messages and free-form replies

## Number Type Options

When creating a WhatsApp sender, you can choose between two types of phone numbers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Platform Numbers" icon="building">
    Use phone numbers purchased through our platform. We handle verification automatically using AI-assisted voice verification.

    **Best for:** Businesses wanting a dedicated business line with automated setup
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Numbers" icon="mobile">
    Use your own mobile number. You verify ownership by receiving an SMS or voice call with a verification code.

    **Best for:** Businesses wanting to use an existing number they already own
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a WhatsApp Sender

Creating a WhatsApp sender starts with choosing your number type, then following the appropriate setup flow.

### Step 1: Choose Your Number Type

Navigate to **WhatsApp Senders** → **Create Sender** and select your preferred number type:

- **Platform Number** — Use a number purchased from our platform (automated AI verification)
- **External Number** — Use your own mobile number (SMS/voice code verification)

---

## Platform Number Setup

If you selected **Platform Number**, follow these steps:

### Step 2: Pre-Verify Your Phone Number

Before connecting to WhatsApp, your phone number must be verified with Meta.

<Warning>
**Call Interception Warning** — During verification, ALL inbound calls to the selected phone number will be intercepted by our verification system for up to 5 minutes.

This means:
- Your normal AI assistant will NOT answer calls during this time
- All calls will go to a silent verification listener
- Regular customers calling this number will experience disrupted service

**DO NOT run this on a production phone number that is actively receiving customer calls!**
</Warning>

1. Select an available phone number (only "normal" type numbers not already used for WhatsApp are shown)
2. Enter a **Display Name** for your business (this will be shown to customers)
3. Optionally add business profile information (about, description, address, category)
4. Click **Start Verification**

The system will automatically verify your number with Meta using AI-assisted voice verification. This typically takes 1-2 minutes.

### Step 3: Select Your Verified Number

Once verification completes:

1. You'll see your verified number in the "Verified Numbers Ready" section
2. Select the number you want to connect
3. Click **Continue to WhatsApp Connection**

### Step 4: Connect to WhatsApp Business

This step connects your verified number to WhatsApp through Meta's Embedded Signup flow.

<Warning>
**CRITICAL: Create a NEW Account** — During the Facebook signup flow, you MUST create a brand new WhatsApp Business Account. Do NOT select an existing WhatsApp Business Account — this will cause the integration to fail.
</Warning>

**Step A: Click "Add new number"**

When the Meta popup appears, look for the "Add new number" option. Do NOT enter a phone number manually.

**Step B: Select your pre-verified number**

From the dropdown, select the phone number you just verified. It will appear in the list because Meta already knows about it from the verification step.

After selecting your number, complete the remaining steps in Facebook's flow (business verification, permissions, etc.) and you'll be redirected back automatically.

All incoming messages will now be routed to your AI assistant for responses.

- **About** — Short description (max 139 characters)
- **Description** — Detailed description of your business
- **Address** — Business address

- **Banner** — Banner image for your profile
- **Websites** — Links to your websites

## Quality Rating & Messaging Limits

Meta tracks your messaging quality and adjusts your limits accordingly.

### Understanding Quality Rating

Your quality rating is based on:
- Block rates (customers blocking your number)
- Spam reports
- Response rates
- Customer feedback

### Messaging Limits

New senders start with limited capacity that increases with good quality:

| Tier | Daily Limit | How to Reach |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Tier 1 | ~250 messages | New sender |
| Tier 2 | 1,000 messages | Maintain quality for 7 days |
| Tier 3 | 10,000 messages | Consistent high quality |
| Tier 4 | 100,000+ messages | Enterprise-level quality |

<Tip>
**Build Quality First** — Focus on quality conversations before scaling up. Send relevant, requested content to maintain a high quality rating.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Number

Select a phone number from a country that matches your target audience. Customers are more likely to engage with local or familiar area codes.

### 2. Set Up Your Display Name Carefully

Your display name appears in customer chats. Use your business name or a clear identifier that customers will recognize and trust.

### 3. Connect an AI Assistant

Link an AI assistant to handle incoming messages automatically. This ensures customers get instant responses 24/7.

### 4. Create Templates Early

Message templates require Meta approval which can take up to 24 hours. Create and submit your templates before you need them.

### 5. Start with Quality Conversations

New senders have messaging limits that increase over time. Focus on quality conversations to build your sender reputation before scaling up.

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Failed

If verification fails, Meta may have temporarily blocked requests. Wait a few minutes before retrying, or try a different phone number.

### Sender Stuck in Pending

If your sender stays in "Pending" status for more than a few minutes:
1. Check if you completed the Meta signup flow
2. Ensure you selected the correct pre-verified number
3. Contact support if the issue persists

### Sender Suspended

If Meta suspends your sender:
1. Review the suspension reason in your sender details
2. Address any policy violations
3. Contact Meta support for appeals
