Learn how to configure each widget type with detailed explanations of every option.

## Creating Widgets

1. Navigate to custom dashboard
2. Click **"Manage Widgets"** then **"Create New Widget"**
3. Select widget type
4. Follow 2-3 step wizard
5. Save and add to dashboard

## Stat Widgets

Single metric display with optional comparison and trend chart.

### Step 1: Basics

**Widget Name**
- Internal identifier for widget list
- Not displayed on dashboard
- Example: "Total Calls This Month"

**Data Table**
- Choose data source: calls, leads, campaigns, assistants, phone_numbers, sms
- Determines available columns

**Aggregation**
- `COUNT` - Total number of records (no column needed)
- `SUM` - Sum of values (requires column selection)
- `AVG` - Average of values (requires column selection)
- `MAX` - Maximum value (requires column selection)
- `MIN` - Minimum value (requires column selection)

**Column** (if SUM/AVG/MAX/MIN selected)
- Select numeric column to aggregate
- Example: `duration` for average call length
- Not needed for COUNT

### Step 2: Display & Filters

**Label** (required)
- Main heading shown on widget
- Example: "Total Calls"

**Description**
- Optional text below the value
- Hidden if comparison enabled
- Example: "Calls made this month"

**Color**
- primary (blue), success (green), warning (yellow), danger (red), info (cyan), gray
- Choose based on metric type (green for positive, red for negative)

**Show Mini Chart**
- Displays small line chart showing daily trend
- Uses same date range as stat

**Compare with Previous Period**
- Shows percentage change from previous period
- Example: Last 7 days vs previous 7 days
- Displays "+15%" or "-8%" with up/down arrow
- Overrides description field

**Date Range**
- Filter by creation date
- Options: Today, 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days

**Conditions** (optional)
- Add filters to narrow data
- Multiple conditions combined with AND
- See [Filtering Data](#filtering-data) section

### Examples

**Total Calls**
```
Aggregation: COUNT
Table: calls
Label: "Total Calls"
Description: "Last 30 days"
Color: primary
Date Range: 30 days
```

**Average Call Duration**
```
Aggregation: AVG
Table: calls
Column: duration
Label: "Avg Duration"
Color: info
Show Mini Chart: Yes
Date Range: 30 days
```

**Successful Appointments**
```
Aggregation: COUNT
Table: calls
Label: "Appointments Booked"
Color: success
Compare: Yes
Date Range: 7 days
Conditions:
  - status = completed
  - evaluation.appointment_booked = true
```

## Chart Widgets

Visualize trends with 8 chart types.

### Step 1: Basics

Same as Stat widgets, plus:

**Chart Type**
- `line` - Trends over time
- `bar` - Compare categories or time periods
- `area` - Filled trend chart
- `pie` - Proportions (requires Group By)
- `donut` - Pie with center hole (requires Group By)
- `polarArea` - Circular with varying radius (requires Group By)
- `radar` - Multi-axis comparison
- `radialBar` - Single progress indicator

### Step 2: Display & Filters

**Label** (required)
- Chart title

**Description**
- Optional subheading text below the chart
- Example: "Last 30 days performance"

**Color**
- Chart primary color
- For pie/donut, uses multi-color palette (blue, green, orange, red, purple, pink)

**Date Range**
- Same as stats

**Group By** OR **Group By Period** (mutually exclusive)

**Group By** - Categorical grouping
- Group data by column values
- Examples: Status, Campaign Id, Assistant Name
- **Required** for pie/donut/polarArea charts
- Optional for bar/radar charts
- **Cannot use** with Group By Period

**Group By Period** - Time-based grouping
- Group by time buckets
- Options: hour, day, week, month
- Used for line/bar/area charts
- **Cannot use** with Group By

**Conditions**
- Same as stats

### Step 3: Advanced (Charts Only)

**Show Grid Lines** (line/bar/area only)
- Background horizontal/vertical lines
- Helps read exact values
- Default: Yes

**Show Legend**
- Color-coded labels
- Default: Yes for pie/donut/polarArea, No for others
- Position: Bottom of chart

**Show Tooltips**
- Hover popups with exact values
- Default: Yes (recommended)

**Show Data Labels**
- Values displayed directly on chart elements
- Default: Yes for pie/donut/polarArea, No for others
- Can clutter line/bar charts

**Show Toolbar** (line/bar/area only)
- Zoom and download controls
- Default: No

**Line Curve** (line/area only)
- `smooth` - Rounded curves (default, visually appealing)
- `straight` - Direct lines (precise)
- `stepline` - Step-wise (good for discrete events)

**Line Width** (line/bar/area only)
- Thickness in pixels (1-10)
- Default: 2px

**Chart Height**
- Vertical space in pixels (200-800)
- Default: 300px
- Taller charts better for more data points

**Enable Gradient** (radialBar only)
- Color gradient effect
- Default: No

**Gradient Color** (if gradient enabled)
- End color for gradient
- Default: Green (#10b981)

**Calculate as Percentage** (radialBar only)
- Automatically calculates percentage from conditions
- Formula: (conditions met / total) × 100
- **Requires:** At least one condition must be added first
- Example: Condition "status = completed" calculates completed leads / total leads × 100
- Appears after adding conditions in Step 2

**Show Footer with Numbers** (radialBar only)
- Displays "X achieved / Y total" below the radialBar chart
- Only visible when "Calculate as Percentage" is enabled
- Shows exact numbers alongside the percentage
- Example footer: "150 achieved / 1,000 total"

**Start Angle** (radialBar only)
- Where the arc begins in degrees (-360° to 360°)
- Default: -140°
- Common values: -140° (default), -90° (left semicircle), 0° (bottom)

**End Angle** (radialBar only)
- Where the arc ends in degrees (-360° to 360°)
- Default: 130°
- **Validation:** Total arc (end - start) cannot exceed 360°
- Common values: 130° (default), 90° (right semicircle), 180° (half circle), 270° (three-quarters)

**Hollow Size** (radialBar only)
- Inner circle size as percentage (0-100%)
- Default: 60%
- Higher value = thinner ring, lower value = thicker ring

**Dash Array** (radialBar only)
- Spacing for dashed ring pattern (0-50)
- Default: 10
- 0 = solid line, higher numbers = more spacing between dashes

### Chart Type Guide

**Line Chart**
- **Use for:** Daily/weekly trends, continuous data
- **Requires:** Group By Period
- **Example:** Calls per day last 30 days

**Bar Chart**
- **Use for:** Category comparison, time periods
- **Can use:** Group By (categories) OR Group By Period (time)
- **Example:** Calls per campaign, hourly distribution

**Area Chart**
- **Use for:** Same as line, emphasizes volume
- **Requires:** Group By Period
- **Example:** Call volume trend

**Pie/Donut Chart**
- **Use for:** Proportions, percentages
- **Requires:** Group By (NOT Group By Period)
- **Example:** Call status breakdown

**Polar Area**
- **Use for:** Like pie but shows magnitude via radius
- **Requires:** Group By
- **Example:** Campaign contribution

**Radar Chart**
- **Use for:** Multi-variable comparison
- **Requires:** Group By
- **Example:** Performance across metrics

**Radial Bar**
- **Use for:** Circular progress indicators showing percentages (0-100%)
- **Does not use:** Group By or Group By Period
- **Percentage Calculation:** Add conditions, then enable "Calculate as Percentage" to automatically compute (conditions met / total) × 100
- **Example:** Lead conversion rate (15%), SMS delivery success (82.8%), goal completion

## Filtering Data

All widgets support conditions to filter data.

### Operators

- `=` - Equals
- `!=` - Not equals
- `>` - Greater than
- `>=` - Greater or equal
- `<` - Less than
- `<=` - Less or equal
- `like` - Contains text
- `in` - One of (comma-separated)
- `not in` - Not one of
- `is null` - No value
- `is not null` - Has value

### Basic Filtering

**Status Filter**
```
Column: Status
Operator: =
Value: completed
```

**Duration Filter**
```
Column: Duration
Operator: >
Value: 60
```

**Multiple Values**
```
Column: Status
Operator: in
Value: completed,in-progress
```

### Evaluation Field Filtering

Filter by post-call evaluation values.

**Setup:**
1. Column: Extracted Variables
2. Extracted Variable Name: Status or Custom variable
3. If Custom variable: Enter field name in Custom Variable Name
4. Variable Value: true/false for booleans, or any + custom value

**Boolean Example - Appointment Booked**
```
Column: Extracted Variables
Extracted Variable Name: Custom variable
Custom Variable Name: appointment_booked
Operator: =
Variable Value: true
```

**Non-Boolean Example - Sentiment**
```
Column: Extracted Variables
Extracted Variable Name: Custom variable
Custom Variable Name: sentiment
Operator: =
Variable Value: any
Custom Value: positive
```

**Check Field Exists**
```
Column: Extracted Variables
Extracted Variable Name: Custom variable
Custom Variable Name: interested
Operator: =
Variable Value: any
```

### Multiple Conditions

Conditions combined with AND:

```
Filter for successful long calls:
Condition 1:
  - Column: Status
  - Operator: =
  - Value: completed

Condition 2:
  - Column: Duration
  - Operator: >
  - Value: 120

Condition 3:
  - Column: Extracted Variables
  - Extracted Variable Name: Custom variable
  - Custom Variable Name: appointment_booked
  - Operator: =
  - Variable Value: true
```

## Best Practices

### Widget Naming

Use descriptive internal names:
- ✅ "Sales Calls - Last 30 Days"
- ✅ "Support Duration Average"
- ❌ "Widget 1"

### Date Ranges

Match range to use case:
- **Today:** Real-time monitoring
- **7 days:** Weekly performance
- **30 days:** Monthly trends
- **90+ days:** Long-term analysis

### Colors

Strategic color usage:
- **Green (success):** Positive metrics
- **Red (danger):** Alert metrics
- **Blue (primary):** Neutral metrics
- **Yellow (warning):** Attention needed
- **Gray (info):** Secondary info

### Performance

Keep dashboards fast:
- Use date range filters
- Limit widgets per dashboard to under 20
- Use COUNT when possible (faster)
- Avoid very long date ranges

## Troubleshooting

**Widget shows "No data"**
- Expand date range
- Remove/adjust filters
- Verify table has records

**Evaluation fields not showing**
- Select assistant in widget config
- Ensure assistant has post-call schema
- Check field names match

**Chart shows empty**
- Pie/donut: Must use Group By (not Period)
- Line/area: Must use Group By Period (not Category)
- Check date range includes data

**Table missing columns**
- Relationship columns need related records
- Evaluation columns need assistant selection
- Variable columns need campaign selection

**"Group By required" error**
- Pie/donut/polarArea charts MUST have Group By
- Cannot use Group By Period with these chart types

**Cannot sort by column**
- Relationship columns (with .) not sortable
- Evaluation fields not sortable
- Use basic columns for sorting
