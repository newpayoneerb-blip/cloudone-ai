The Test Chat interface provides a quick way to test your assistant's conversation flow without making actual phone calls.

## Accessing Test Chat

1. Navigate to your assistant's page
2. Click the **"Test Assistant"** button with the chat icon
3. A chat interface will open in a slide-over panel

## How It Works

The Test Chat interface simulates a conversation with your assistant:

- **Text-based interaction:** Type messages instead of speaking
- **Real AI responses:** Your assistant processes messages using the same logic as phone calls
- **Variable testing:** Test how your assistant handles variables and data collection
- **Tool execution:** See how your assistant uses configured tools and functions
- **Fast iteration:** Quickly test prompt changes without phone calls

## When to Use Test Chat

**Ideal for:**
- Testing conversation flow and logic
- Verifying prompt behavior and responses
- Debugging variable collection
- Testing tool/function calls
- Rapid prompt iteration

**Not suitable for:**
- Testing voice quality or speech recognition
- Testing call transfers (use phone testing)
- Testing phone-specific features
- Evaluating conversation timing and pacing

## Testing Workflow

**1. Test conversation flow with chat interface:**
- Verify your assistant understands user intents
- Check that variables are collected correctly
- Ensure tools execute as expected
- Validate response quality

**2. Test voice quality with Web Call:**
- Verify voice clarity and tone
- Check response timing and pacing
- Test interruption handling

**3. Final testing with Phone Call:**
- Test all features including call transfers
- Verify real-world call quality
- Test edge cases and error handling

<Note>
Test Chat creates conversation records that appear in your **Conversations** page, helping you review and analyze test sessions.

## Cost Considerations

Test Chat interactions:
- Use AI processing credits from your account balance
- Are typically more cost-effective than phone testing
- Allow for faster iteration with immediate feedback
- Create conversation records for later review

<Tip>
Use Test Chat for initial prompt development, then move to phone testing for final validation before deploying to production.
