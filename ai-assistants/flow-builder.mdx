## Overview

Flow Builder provides:

- **Visual design** - Drag-and-drop nodes on a canvas
- **Multiple node types** - Messages, prompts, actions, and more
- **Branching logic** - Create different paths based on responses
- **Settings panel** - Configure agent personality and behavior

## Node Types

Flow Builder has 5 node types, each with a specific purpose:

<Frame>
  <img src="/resources/ai-assistants/flow-builder-nodes.png" alt="Flow Builder Node Types" />
</Frame>

### Start Node (Green)

<Card title="Start Node" icon="play" color="#22c55e">
The entry point of every conversation. Every flow must have exactly one Start node.

**Properties:**
- **Greeting** - The initial message when the call begins

**Example:** "Hi, this is Sarah from Acme Insurance. How are you today?"
</Card>

### Speak Node (Blue)

<Card title="Speak Node" icon="volume-high" color="#3b82f6">
Delivers a pre-written message exactly as specified. Use when you need precise wording.

**Properties:**
- **Text** - The exact message to speak
- **Outcomes** - Different paths based on customer response

**Example:** "We're offering a limited-time 20% discount on all plans. Would you like to hear more?"
</Card>

### Prompt Node (Purple)

<Card title="Prompt Node" icon="message" color="#a855f7">
Gives the AI instructions on how to respond. More flexible than Speak nodes - the AI generates contextual responses.

**Properties:**
- **Prompt** - Instructions for the AI
- **Outcomes** - Different paths based on response categories

**Example prompt:** "Ask the customer about their current insurance coverage. Be conversational and empathetic. Listen for mentions of their family size, budget concerns, or timeline."
</Card>

### Action Node (Orange)

<Card title="Action Node" icon="bolt" color="#f97316">
Executes special actions during the call.

**Action Types:**
- **Call Forward** - Transfer to another number
- **Book Appointment** - Schedule using connected calendar
- **Custom Action** - Trigger a custom mid-call tool

**Example:** Forward to sales team at +1-555-123-4567 when customer is ready to purchase.
</Card>

### End Node (Red)

<Card title="End Node" icon="phone-slash" color="#ef4444">
Terminates the call or transfers to another destination.

**End Types:**
- **End Call** - Hang up with a closing message
- **Forward Call** - Transfer to a phone number
- **Transfer Agent** - Hand off to another assistant

**Example closing:** "Thank you for your time today. Have a great day!"
</Card>

## Working with Nodes

### Adding Nodes

1. Click **+ Add Node** in the bottom toolbar
2. Select the node type from the dropdown
3. The node appears on the canvas
4. Drag it to your desired position

### Connecting Nodes

1. Hover over a node's bottom edge to see the **output handle** (small circle)
2. Click and drag from the output handle
3. Connect to another node's **input handle** (top edge)
4. Release to create the connection

### Editing Nodes

1. Click on any node to select it
2. The node's properties appear in a panel
3. Edit the text, prompt, or settings
4. Changes save automatically to the canvas

### Deleting Nodes

- Select a node and press **Delete** key, or
- Select a node and click the 🗑️ button in the toolbar

<Warning>
The Start node cannot be deleted. Every flow must have one Start node.
</Warning>

## Outcomes (Multiple Paths)

Speak and Prompt nodes can have multiple **outcomes** - different paths based on how the customer responds.

### Adding Outcomes

1. Select a Speak or Prompt node
2. In the properties panel, find **Outcomes**
3. Click **Add Outcome**
4. Name the outcome (e.g., "Interested", "Not interested", "Wants callback")

### Connecting Outcomes

Each outcome appears as a colored dot at the bottom of the node. Connect each outcome to a different destination node to create branching logic.

  <img src="/resources/ai-assistants/flow-builder-branching.png" alt="Conversation Branching with Outcomes" />
</Frame>

**Example flow:**

```
[Start] → [Ask about interest]
              ↓
         [Prompt: "Ask if interested"]
              ↓
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ↓         ↓         ↓
[Interested] [Maybe] [Not Interested]
    ↓         ↓         ↓
[Book Demo] [Send Info] [Thank & End]
```

## Voicemail Settings

Configure what happens when voicemail is detected:

- **Voicemail Message** - Message to leave if voicemail answers
- **End Call on Voicemail** - Toggle to automatically hang up on voicemail

## Saving Your Flow

Click the **Save** button in the top-right corner to save your flow to the assistant.

The flow is stored as JSON in your assistant's system prompt field. If you switch to the Classic Editor, you'll see the raw JSON data.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with a basic flow and add complexity gradually. Test at each step.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Prompt Nodes" icon="brain">
    Prompt nodes give the AI flexibility. Use them for dynamic, context-aware responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plan Your Outcomes" icon="diagram-project">
    Before building, sketch the main paths: positive, negative, and neutral responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="vial">
    Make test calls covering all paths. Verify each outcome leads to the right destination.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Nodes won't connect">
    - Ensure you're dragging from an **output handle** (bottom) to an **input handle** (top)
    - Check that you're not creating a circular connection
    - The Start node only has an output, End node only has an input
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flow not saving">
    - Check your internet connection
    - Ensure you have at least one node (besides Start)
    - Look for any validation errors in the settings panel
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="AI not following the flow">
    - Use Speak nodes for exact wording requirements
    - Make Prompt node instructions more specific
    - Check that outcomes are clearly defined and connected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
