Configure the objective of the assistant and the tools it can use during calls.

## Knowledge Base

Give information to the assistant to use as a knowledge base when responding to customers. From website contents, documents, etc.

### Knowledge Base Selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose Knowledge Base" icon="book-open">
    Select a knowledge base store containing relevant information for the assistant to use.
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Must be created in your [Knowledge Bases](/knowledgebases) section first
    - Shows status (Active, Processing, etc.) and description
    - Only your own knowledge bases are available
    
    <Tip>
    Create knowledge bases from website content, PDFs, or custom documents to give your assistant domain-specific information. For comprehensive setup guide including content types, processing status, website scraping, and troubleshooting, see the complete [Knowledge Base Guide](/conversation-design/knowledge-bases).
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Base Mode" icon="brain">
    Choose how the AI will use the knowledge base.
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Function Call" icon="function">
        **Recommended for most cases**
        
        Uses a function call to search for information in the knowledgebase, only when needed. More accurate and efficient.
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Prompt Injection" icon="syringe">
        **For simple use cases**
        
        Performs a search after every customer speech. More accurate but can be slower without filler audios.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    <Note>
    **Mode availability:** Speech-to-Speech and Dualplex modes only support Function Call mode.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Custom Mid-Call Tools

Create and assign your own custom tools that AI can use **mid-call** with the customer.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Custom Tools" icon="plus">
    Build tools tailored to your specific business needs: API integrations, database queries, custom workflows, and external service calls.
    
    **Quick action:** Direct link to tool creation page.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Assign to Assistant" icon="link">
    Select which custom tools this assistant can use with multiple selection, search by name/description, and real-time assignment.
    
    **Scope:** Only your own tools are available.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
Read the [Custom Tools documentation](/ai-assistants/custom-tools) for detailed guides on creating and configuring custom tools.
</Tip>

## Default Tools

Choose built-in tools that AI can use **mid-call** with the customer.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi Call Transfer" icon="phone-arrow-right">
    Route calls to multiple destination phone numbers like different people or departments according to your flow.

    **Use cases:**
    - Escalation to human agents
    - Department routing
    - Specialist handoffs

    **Configuration options:**
    - **Standard mode:** Use regular phone numbers (e.g., +1234567890)
    - **Advanced mode:** Use SIP URI format for SIP providers (e.g., sip:+1234567890@sip-server)

    **For SIP integrations:**
    - Set transfer to "Advanced" mode
    - Use SIP URI format: `sip:number@sip-server`
    - Verify your SIP provider supports SIP REFER
    - Test with different URI formats if transfers fail

    <Note>
    **Prompt instruction:** Include in your system prompt something like "call the transfer function when the user requests to speak with someone else" to ensure the AI uses this tool appropriately.
    </Note>

    <Tip>
    If transfers aren't working, see our [SIP Integration troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/sip-integration#transfer-phone-call-not-working) for detailed solutions.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

    - Natural conversation conclusion
    - Objective achieved
    - Customer satisfaction confirmed
    
    <Note>
    **Prompt instruction:** If the AI doesn't call the end call function automatically, include in your system prompt "call the hang_up function to close the call" when the conversation should end.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DTMF Input" icon="hashtag">
    Easily send keypad inputs during outbound calls, enabling smooth navigation through IVR menus and automated workflows. The AI navigates using keypad buttons when calling and responding to prompts.

    - Enter extension numbers
    - Input security codes
    - IVR system navigation

### Variable Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Definition" icon="code">
    Create call variables to pass information to your assistant before the call starts.
    
    **Setup process:**
    - Define variable names and default values

Call variables are essential for personalizing AI conversations. They allow the AI to use specific customer information during calls, making interactions more relevant and effective.
</Note>

## Call Flow Configuration

### Who Speaks First?

Control whether your assistant or the customer initiates the conversation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Assistant" icon="robot">
    **Default behavior:** Assistant starts the conversation
    
    The AI will immediately greet the caller and begin the conversation flow as soon as the call connects.
    
    **Best for:** Most outbound scenarios, sales calls, appointment reminders
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Customer" icon="user">
    **Wait for customer:** Assistant listens first
    
    If you choose "Customer", the AI will wait for the customer to speak first before responding.
    
    **Best for:** Inbound support calls, reception scenarios, reactive assistance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Initial Message

Configure the first thing your assistant says when the call begins.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Initial Message Text" icon="message">
    Write the opening message your assistant will speak at the start of each call.
    
    **Best practices:**
    - Keep it concise and friendly
    - Introduce your company/purpose clearly
    - Set expectations for the conversation
    - Use variables for personalization (e.g., `{customer_name}`)
    
    **Example:** "Hi {customer_name}, this is Sarah from ABC Company. I'm calling to follow up on your recent inquiry about our services. Do you have a moment to chat?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Initial Audio File" icon="volume">
    **Optional:** Upload a custom audio file instead of text-to-speech
    
    **Requirements:**
    - MP3 or WAV format
    - Clear, high-quality recording
    - Professional voice and tone
    - Matches your assistant's voice if using voice cloning
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Perfect pronunciation and delivery
    - Consistent brand voice
    - Professional first impression
    - No text-to-speech latency for opening
    
    <Tip>
    This works best if the AI voice is cloned using the same voice used in the initial audio.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
See our [Initial Message guide](/ai-assistants/initial-message) for detailed best practices and examples.
</Note>

## System Prompt

Define the assistant's personality, objectives, and behavior guidelines.

### Editing Tools

Choose the editing experience that works best for you:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Prompt Editor" icon="sparkles" href="/ai-assistants/ai-prompt-editor">
    **Chat-based editing with AI assistance**

    Describe changes in plain language and let AI suggest intelligent modifications. Review and accept/reject each change individually.

    **Best for:** Quick iterations, improving existing prompts, text-focused editing
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flow Builder" icon="share-nodes" href="/ai-assistants/flow-builder">
    **Visual drag-and-drop editor**

    Design conversation flows by connecting nodes on a canvas. Create branching logic and multi-path decision trees visually.
