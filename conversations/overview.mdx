Conversations provide a record of all text-based interactions with your AI assistants through web widgets, WhatsApp, and test interfaces.

## What Are Conversations?

Conversations are text-based chat sessions between users and your AI assistants through web widgets, WhatsApp Business, and test interfaces.

## Conversation Sources

Conversations are created through:

### Web Widget Interactions
When website visitors use your embedded web widget in chat or voice & chat mode, each session creates a conversation record.

**Includes:**
- All messages exchanged
- Variables collected from pre-chat forms
- Variables extracted during conversation
- Total cost and token usage
- Session timestamps

### WhatsApp Conversations
When customers message your WhatsApp Business number, each conversation thread creates a conversation record.

**Includes:**
- Complete message history
- Customer phone number
- AI assistant responses
- Cost and usage metrics
- 24-hour messaging window status

<Info>
WhatsApp conversations follow Meta's 24-hour messaging window rules. Within this window, your AI can send free-form replies. After 24 hours, you must use approved template messages to re-engage. Learn more in our [WhatsApp documentation](/whatsapp/overview).
</Info>

### Test Chat Sessions
When you test your assistant using the Test Chat interface, each test session creates a conversation record marked as "Test."

**Useful for:**
- Reviewing test sessions
- Debugging conversation flow
- Analyzing assistant responses
- Validating variable collection

## Why Track Conversations?

## Conversation Data

Each conversation includes:
- Message history with timestamps
- Variables collected (from pre-chat forms or extracted by AI)
- Cost and token usage metrics
- Conversation type (Test, Web Widget, or WhatsApp)
- Customer identifier (phone number for WhatsApp)

## Accessing Conversations

Navigate to the **Conversations (chat)** page from your dashboard to view all conversation records.

The navigation badge shows your total conversation count, helping you track activity at a glance.

<Note>
Conversations are tracked separately from phone calls. Phone calls are tracked in the **Calls** page, while conversations (text-based chat) are tracked here.
