Import large numbers of leads from CSV or Excel files with automatic validation, background processing, and comprehensive error reporting.

## Import Process Overview

The lead import system supports:
- **CSV and Excel files** (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- **Background processing** for large files
- **Automatic validation** with error reporting
- **Secondary contacts** in same import
- **Variable mapping** from assistant configuration

## Preparing Your Import File

### Required Columns
Your import file must include:
- **phone_number:** Primary contact phone number (required)
- **Variables:** Columns matching your [assistant's configured variables](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#call-variables)

### Optional Columns
- **Secondary contact columns:** Additional phone numbers
- **Variable overrides:** Custom values for specific leads

### File Format Example
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,company,budget_range,secondary_phone_1,secondary_phone_2
+14155551234,John Smith,ABC Corp,10k-50k,+14155551235,+14155551236
+14155557890,Jane Doe,XYZ Inc,50k-100k,+14155557891,
+14155554567,Bob Johnson,Tech Start,5k-10k,,
```

## Import Configuration

### 1. Select Campaign
Choose the target campaign from the dropdown. The assistant's variables will determine what columns are expected during mapping.

### 2. Secondary Contacts
Select how many secondary phone numbers per lead (0-10). If your file contains additional phone numbers beyond the primary contact, specify the count here.

### 3. Phone Number Format
Choose the format of your phone numbers:

**International Format (Recommended)**
- Numbers already include country code with + prefix
- Example: `+40741234567`, `+14155551234`
- No country selection needed
- Can mix multiple countries in same file

**National Format**
- Numbers without country code prefix
- Example: `0741234567`, `7775551234`
- **Must select country code** during import
- **Important:** Separate your file by country - all numbers must be from the same country per file
- System will add the selected country code to all numbers

<Warning>
When using national format, you must import one file per country. Do not mix numbers from different countries in the same file.
</Warning>

### 4. Country Code Selection
Only appears when "National Format" is selected. Choose the country that matches all phone numbers in your file. The system will automatically prepend the country code to all numbers.

## Import Steps

### 1. Start Import Process
1. **Navigate to Leads** section or Campaign leads tab
2. **Click "Import Leads"** button  
3. **Select campaign** for lead assignment
4. **Download sample** file to see expected format

### 2. Upload and Map Columns
1. **Choose file:** Select your CSV or Excel file
2. **Column mapping:** Map your file columns to system fields:
   - **Phone Number (required):** Select the column containing phone numbers
   - **Assistant variables:** Map each variable to its corresponding column
   - **Secondary contacts:** If configured, map secondary phone numbers and variables
3. **Auto-detection:** System auto-detects mappings based on common header names
4. **Review and import:** Confirm mappings and click "Import" to begin

### 3. Background Processing
- **Queue processing:** Large files processed in background
- **Progress tracking:** Import status updates automatically
- **Notification:** Email notification when import completes
- **Error reporting:** Download report of any failed rows

## Validation Rules

### Phone Number Validation
- **Format checking:** International format preferred (+1234567890)
- **Duplicate detection:** Prevents duplicate phone numbers
- **Invalid numbers:** Automatically flagged and skipped

### Variable Validation
- **Required fields:** Variables marked as required must have values
- **Data types:** Text, number, boolean validation where applicable
- **Length limits:** Maximum character limits enforced

### Secondary Contact Validation
- **Phone format:** Same validation as primary numbers
- **Unique numbers:** Secondary contacts must differ from primary
- **Variable consistency:** Secondary contact variables validated independently

## Error Handling

### Automatic Error Handling
The import system automatically handles validation errors:
- **Valid rows imported:** Successfully validated leads are added to the campaign
- **Invalid rows skipped:** Rows that fail validation are automatically excluded
- **Error report generated:** Detailed report of all failed rows is created
- **Partial success:** Import completes successfully with all valid leads, failed rows are recorded

### Common Validation Errors
- **Invalid phone numbers:** Incorrect format or impossible numbers
- **Missing required fields:** Empty values for required variables
- **Duplicate phone numbers:** Phone number already exists in system
- **File format issues:** Corrupted or unsupported file format

### Error Report Download
After import completion:
- **Download link** provided in notification
- **Detailed error descriptions** for each failed row
- **Correction guidance** for fixing issues
- **Re-import capability** with corrected data

## Secondary Contacts Import

### Multiple Phone Numbers per Lead
Include additional columns for secondary contacts:
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,secondary_phone_1,secondary_phone_2,secondary_phone_3
+14155551234,John Smith,+14155551235,+14155551236,+14155551237
```

### Secondary Contact Variables
Add variables specific to secondary contacts:
```csv
phone_number,customer_name,secondary_phone_1,secondary_1_name,secondary_1_role
+14155551234,John Smith,+14155551235,Jane Smith,Decision Maker
```

### Contact Ordering
- **Primary contact:** Always called first
- **Secondary order:** Called in column order (secondary_phone_1, then secondary_phone_2, etc.)
- **Campaign coordination:** Respects campaign retry settings between contacts

## Large File Handling

### Background Processing
- **Automatic queuing:** Files over 1000 rows processed in background
- **Memory efficiency:** Streaming processing prevents timeouts
- **Progress tracking:** Real-time status updates
- **System performance:** No impact on platform performance during import

### Notification System
- **Email notifications:** Sent when import completes
- **Success summary:** Number of leads imported successfully
- **Error summary:** Count and details of failed rows
- **Download links:** Access to error reports and imported data

### Processing Time
- **Small files (< 100 rows):** Usually complete within 1 minute
- **Medium files (100-1000 rows):** 2-5 minutes typical
- **Large files (1000+ rows):** 10-30 minutes depending on complexity
- **Very large files (10k+ rows):** May take several hours

## Best Practices

- **Use sample file:** Download provided template for correct format
- **Phone format:** International format without separators (+1234567890)
- **Clean data:** Remove empty rows and validate content
- **Test first:** Start with small batch to verify format
- **Match variables:** Ensure columns align with assistant configuration
