## What is SIP Integration?

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) integration allows you to connect your existing phone system to Autocalls.ai. Think of it as building a bridge between your current phone setup and our AI platform. This means you can:

- Use your existing phone numbers with our AI assistants
- Keep your current phone system and provider
- Make and receive calls through your existing setup
- Maintain full control of your numbers
- Reduce carrier costs by using local VoIP providers with better rates

## How It Works

When you integrate your phone system with Autocalls.ai:

1. **Inbound Calls**: Calls to your numbers are routed through your phone system to our AI assistants
2. **Outbound Calls**: Our AI assistants can make calls appearing from your numbers
3. **Management**: You keep managing your numbers through your current provider
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage your VoIP provider's competitive rates for call termination

## Integration Options

You can connect your phone system to Autocalls.ai in two ways:

### 1. PBX Extension Integration

This is like giving our AI platform an "extension" on your phone system:

- **What it is**: Connect a specific extension from your PBX/phone system
- **Perfect for**:
  - Testing the integration
  - Routing specific extensions to AI
  - Simple setup with existing phone systems
- **You'll need**:
  - Your extension number (e.g., 1000)
  - Extension username and password
  - Your PBX server address (e.g., pbx.yourcompany.com)

**Real-world example**:

```
Your office uses extensions 1001-1010 for staff
You set up extension 1011 for the AI assistant
Calls to 1011 go to the AI
The AI can make calls appearing as extension 1011
```

### 2. Direct Number Integration

This connects specific phone numbers to our platform:

- **What it is**: Route one or more of your phone numbers to our AI
- **Perfect for**:
  - Dedicated AI phone lines
  - Customer service numbers
  - Sales or support lines
- **You'll need**:
  - Your phone number (e.g., +1 555 0123)
  - SIP credentials from your provider
  - Provider's SIP server address

**Real-world example**:

```
You have a support number: +1 555 0123
You connect this number to our AI
All calls to +1 555 0123 are handled by the AI assistant
The AI makes outbound calls showing +1 555 0123
```

## Authentication & Call Flow

### Bidirectional Configuration

The SIP integration uses the same credentials for both inbound and outbound calls:

- **Inbound Calls** (VoIP → Autocalls.ai):

  ```
  Your VoIP system authenticates using username/password
  ↓
  Calls reach our platform
  ↓
  AI assistant answers
  ```

- **Outbound Calls** (Autocalls.ai → VoIP):
  ```
  AI initiates call
  ↓
  Our platform authenticates to your VoIP using same username/password
  ↓
  Call reaches destination
  ```

### Credential Synchronization

For the integration to work properly:

1. The credentials you set in Autocalls.ai dashboard must match exactly with your VoIP configuration
2. The same username/password combination is used for both directions
3. Any changes to credentials must be updated in both systems

<Warning>
  If you change credentials in your VoIP system, remember to update them in
  Autocalls.ai dashboard (and vice versa) to maintain the connection.
</Warning>

## Setting Up Your Integration

### Step 1: Gather Your Information

For PBX Extension:

```
Extension number: e.g., 1000
Server address: e.g., pbx.company.com
Username: Your extension username
Password: Your extension password
```

For Direct Number:

```
Phone number: e.g., +1 555 0123
SIP server: e.g., sip.provider.com
Username: Provided by your phone company
Password: Provided by your phone company
```

### Step 2: Configure in Dashboard

1. Go to your Autocalls.ai dashboard
2. Navigate to **Your Phone Numbers**
3. Click "Integrate SIP trunk"

### Step 3: Select SIP Trunk Type 

At the top of the form, select one of these trunk types:

- **SIP Extension** - Use this if you already have an existing SIP credential (an extension) provided by your VoIP provider.
- **Phone Number (DID)** - Use this if you want to integrate a dedicated Direct Inward Dial (DID) number instead of a generic SIP extension.

For PBX Extension:
```
Extension number: e.g., 1000
Username: Your extension username
Password: Your extension password
```
<img height="200" src="/resources/sip-integration-sip-type.png" />

For Direct Number:

```
Phone number: e.g., +1 555 0123
Username: Provided by your phone company
Password: Provided by your phone company
```
<img height="200" src="/resources/sip-integration-did.png" />

### Step 4: Outbound Settings

These settings control how Autocalls.ai sends outbound calls through your SIP provider.

- **SIP Address** - Enter the address/server of the SIP trunk without the port.
- **Outbound Proxy (Fixed IP)** - Some SIP providers require calls to originate from a single, whitelisted IP address. Configure this as follows:
  - **Toggle ON** - If your SIP provider requires a fixed source IP, enable Outbound proxy will come from a fixed IP address. Autocalls.ai will then send all outbound requests through a known static IP.
  Use this option only if your provider explicitly requires a single source IP.
  - **Toggle OFF:** - If your provider accepts calls from any IP, leave this option off. In that case, Autocalls.ai will send calls from dynamic IPs.

```
SIP address: (e.g., pbx.company.com/sip.provider.com)
```

### Step 5: Number Format Configuration

This tells our system how to format phone numbers when making calls. Choose based on your provider's requirements:

1. **International with +**

   ```
   Format: +[country][number]
   Example: +1 202 555 0123
   SIP Request: sip:+12025550123@your.pbx.com
   ```

2. **International without +**

   ```
   Format: [country][number]
   Example: 1 202 555 0123
   SIP Request: sip:12025550123@your.pbx.com
   ```

3. **National format**
   ```
   Format: [local number]
   Example: 0741926265
   SIP Request: sip:0741926265@your.pbx.com
   ```

### Step 6: Inbound Settings

These settings determine how Autocalls.ai receives and authenticates inbound calls from your SIP provider.

1. **Our SIP Address** - Autocalls.ai assigns a unique inbound SIP URI ```5wed79aeavr.sip.livekit.cloud```. Your SIP provider must be configured to send inbound calls to this address by pointing their outbound trunk or routing rule to this URI.
2. **IP Address (Whitelist IPs)** - If your SIP provider can send calls from a known set of public IP addresses, choose IP Address. Then add each provider IP to the whitelist under Inbound Authentication.
3. **Username and Password** - If your provider supports SIP auth, choose Username and password. The same credentials you entered under Outbound Settings (username/password) will be used to authenticate inbound calls. Make sure your provider’s PBX is configured to include those credentials.

### Step 7: Country Selection 
Select the country where your SIP trunk is provisioned.

### Step 8: Verify Setup

After configuration:

1. Make a test call to your number/extension
2. Check that the AI assistant answers
3. Use the test call feature to verify outbound calling

## Security Requirements

Your SIP credentials need to be secure:

- **Username**: Your extension number or provider-supplied username
- **Password must have**:
  - 12 or more characters
  - Numbers
  - Upper and lowercase letters
  - Special characters recommended
