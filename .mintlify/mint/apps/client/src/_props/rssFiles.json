We ship new features regularly to enhance your AI calling experience.\n</Note>\n\n<Update label=\"V1.7.2\" description=\"Jan 26 2026\">\n  ### 🔥 New Call Features: Warm Transfers + Keypad Digits Collection\n\n  We’ve added two major capabilities to make AI phone agents more reliable in real-world support and sales scenarios — smoother human handoff and faster, more accurate data capture.\n\n  ☎️ Warm Call Transfer (Hold + Brief + Connect)\n\n  <Frame>\n    <img src=\"/resources/SrwBrXtF1hUPX4WDd53NM7Rfh0YxrhP0NFewY5AU.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n  </Frame>\n\n  When a caller asks to speak with a human, your AI can now run a **true warm transfer**: it puts the customer on hold (with music or silence), dials a supervisor/agent, **briefs them with context**, and only then connects both sides.\n\n  **Why it’s better**\n\n  * ✅ **Context preserved:** agents don’t start cold — they already know what the customer needs.\n  * 🎶 **Professional experience:** caller hears a hold message + hold music while the agent is reached.\n  * 🔁 \\*\\*More compatible transfers:\\*\\***Web calls can now transfer to real human phone agents** (the initial interaction doesn’t need to be a phone call anymore).\n  * For **SIP trunks without SIP REFER**, warm transfer now works by creating a new **SIP INVITE** and merging calls — no REFER required.\n\n  **Configurable options** Supervisor number, caller ID mode, hold music/silence, hold message, supervisor briefing instructions, and the final “connected” message.\n\n  ⌨️ Customer Keypad Digits Collection (DTMF)\n\n  <Frame>\n    <img src=\"/resources/0R4hEUj2GrQ4btiOSJRqOqD22k7ZE87dhYECpzru.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n  </Frame>\n\n  Customers can now enter digits on their phone keypad during a conversation, and the assistant receives the input instantly and continues naturally.\n\n  **How it works**\n\n  * Runs **in the background** — no awkward pauses\n  * Auto-submits after a configurable timeout (default **5s**)\n  * Instant submit when the user presses **#** or \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n  * Works alongside voice: customers can **speak or type**\n\n  **Perfect for** Account numbers, PINs, phone numbers, license plates, order codes — especially when accuracy and privacy matter.\n\n  **Configurable options** Input timeout + submit key (# or \\*).\n\n  These upgrades make your assistants feel more human, more reliable, and easier to deploy in production support environments.\n</Update>\n\n<Update label=\"v1.7.1\" description=\"Jan 10 2026\">\n  ### ↗️ WhatsApp External Numbers Integration\n\n  You can now connect **external WhatsApp sender numbers;** like your own mobile number or SIP/business-owned lines and use them to **fully automate WhatsApp messaging** inside the platform.\n\n  ### What’s included\n\n  * 📲 **Bring your own sender**: use your existing number instead of being limited to platform-provisioned WhatsApp numbers\n  * 🤖 **Inbound + outbound automation**: the AI can reply to incoming messages and send outbound follow-ups, reminders, and lead qualification messages\n  * ✅ **Simplified onboarding** via Meta Embedded Signup with **OTP verification** (SMS/voice) — no complicated Meta setup guesswork\n\n  ### Where you’ll find it\n\n  Create a new WhatsApp sender from the platform and choose the **External Number** path. Once connected, you can submit message templates for approval to Meta and use your connected number to **send and receive WhatsApp messages** with AI handling the conversation end-to-end.\n\n  This update unlocks a more “native” customer experience — your AI can operate at scale on WhatsApp while keeping your brand identity and sender number consistent.\n</Update>\n\n<Update label=\"v1.7.0\" description=\"Jan 8 2026\">\n  ### ✍️ AI Prompt Writer, 🧩 Flow builder & 🟢 Whatsapp native integration\n\n  This update packs three major upgrades that change how you build assistants end-to-end: **prompting becomes conversational**, **flows become visual**, and **WhatsApp becomes native** — with a setup that skips the usual Meta headaches.\n\n  ## ✍️ AI Prompt Writer\n\n  <Frame>\n    <img src=\"/resources/Opnlq1kcM53iN4TWEkiPd7q7mmXjzRUE28xR3ITg.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n  </Frame>\n\n  Edit prompts by chatting with AI — no manual prompt engineering required.\n\n  * **Conversational editing:** just say what you want (“make it more friendly”, “add return policy info”) and the AI updates your system prompt.\n  * **Smart diff preview:** review changes before applying — additions, removals, and edits are clearly highlighted.\n  * **Accept/reject control:** apply suggestions one-by-one or in bulk, so you stay in full control.\n  * **Quick actions:** one-click improvements like *Make concise*, *Add detail*, *Improve clarity*.\n  * **Variables + schema built-in:** manage pre-call variables (e.g. {customer_name}) and define structured post-call extraction fields (string/number/boolean) without leaving the editor.\n  * **Template library:** start from proven templates for sales, support, scheduling, surveys.\n\n  Now you can refine assistant behavior quickly — without technical skills.\n\n  ## 🧩 Flow Builder\n\n  <Frame>\n    <img src=\"/resources/Bqsbdh2d6e9z2vqWyafDnVwh2kKYv57Xk25A97kt.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n  </Frame>\n\n  Design conversation flows visually with drag-and-drop — perfect for production ready flows.\n\n  * **Node-based builder (5 node types):** Start, Speak, Prompt, Action, End.\n  * **Branching logic:** build multi-path conversations (Interested / Maybe / Not Interested) with clear outcomes.\n  * **Settings panel:** customize agent personality (name, language, assertiveness, humor) per flow.\n  * **Auto-layout:** one click to neatly organize your flow.\n  * **Import/Export JSON:** share flows across assistants or teammates instantly.\n\n  Build complex, multi-branch scripts without writing long prompts — faster iteration, cleaner structure, easier collaboration.\n\n  ## 🟢 WhatsApp Native Integration\n\n  <Frame>\n    <img src=\"/resources/uCyFS8rdZaEBpRoz4NBKZRGubcU2lzwAnvDlASWc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />\n  </Frame>\n\n  Connect your AI assistant to WhatsApp Business in minutes — and let it handle **both inbound and outbound messaging** automatically.\n\n  ### ✅ Setup that’s actually easy\n\n  Meta’s WhatsApp onboarding is notoriously complex (business setup, verification, templates, embedded signup, compliance).
